1. Please propose an analytics project or something specific you would like to do to help improve the baseball team
   at the University of Miami.

  Although I have only brief experience with machine learning, I believe I can improve my skills in the enviornment that the internship
  offers and construct predictive models. For example, in the area of pitch optimization, when should a pitcher throw a slider
  vs a curveball, and where in the zone should it be located? Data regarding a pitcher's stamina and arsenal, as well as the tendencies
  of the batter can be used to build models that that forecast the desicions players ought to make. Refined, selective pitching
  wins games and I believe I can help contribute to make that possible.

2. Give a brief description of your background in coding (specifically Python), statistics and baseball.

   I first learned to code in Python during my Sophomore year when I took CSC115 as an elective. I learned mostly the
   basics, but learned a handful of data structures and have been steadily improving my skills. Although I'm more
   comfortable using Java, I can still accomplish many tasks in Python. I am currently taking a statistics class (MTH224)
   and feel comfortable analyzing data through spreadsheets. I've prior experience as a political consultant intern
   and in that role I compressed data into top line figures. As for baseball, I haven't played since middle school, but
   know all the rules, regularly follow MLB (especially the NY Mets), and have used Baseball Reference and Fangraphs for
   years. Although I don't know the formulas, I'm aware of the variables that go into and the scale of the statistics
   that appear on those pages from WAR to Hard Hit %.
