# Rockies_BBStats_Analysis
This respository is meant to be viewed by the University of Miami Baseball Analytics Team as part of the internship application. It analyzes the last 2 months of Colorado Rockies data from Baseball Savant. 
The "Analysis" code looks for the highest average exit velocity on the team with 2 ball counts. The "Visualization" code displays a bar graph of the batting average of every player with at least 20 at bats 
where there was a runner in scoring position.
